# DBCE F-Zero SNES Unified Preview

F-Zero SNES and optional BS Deluxe use one native host, existing launcher,
settings set and version. Wheel, FFB, telemetry, recording/replay and experimental
triples are internal features. F-Zero X is a different product. The source
folders in E:/Source are attached development worktrees, not separate products
to merge. The in-place rename to `dbce-mods-fzero-snes` is complete, retaining the fork relationship,
upstream attribution/history and atomic feature commits.

Canonical metadata is [game-product.json](../game-product.json). The
[identity policy](PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md) defines the numeric upstream base,
source-qualified preview label, reviewed repository-name migration and remaining
consolidation actions. As verified on 2026-10-02, default `main` and the retained source lane
[`codex/unified-product-20261001`](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-mods-fzero-snes/tree/codex/unified-product-20261001)
both contain reviewed source `14ea520bf97700f6bd5bb832b1daf1fdb6483f50`.
Historical release ZIPs are not unified preview binaries; no DBCE unified
binary release or installation promotion has occurred.

## Install and setup

Extract the complete candidate ZIP to a new folder. Run `Setup.cmd` to open the
existing launcher, choose your own USA ROM, and configure controls there.
`Setup.cmd` only opens that launcher; it does not rewrite settings or profiles.
See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the feature settings and recovery steps.

To update a working install, first close it normally and back up its complete
folder. Verify the candidate in a separate folder before parent-coordinated
deployment. Retain config.ini, fzero-video.ini, keybinds.ini, rom.cfg, saves,
music and user shader folders. Do not extract over a running game. The candidate
does not include an installer that modifies an existing installation.

## Reproducible candidate packaging

The historical `make_release.py` release route is retained. It expects embedded
BS Deluxe data and is not this candidate's distribution route. The unified
candidate excludes the private generated BS module, its embedded payload and
all user data. A stock-only source build must omit FZERO_DELUXE_GEN_DIR and
FZERO_DELUXE_DATA_FILE. No binary from the current BS-equipped installed build
is repackaged here. Public packaging of that module requires a separate review
of distribution rights and build inputs.

`package_unified.py` accepts a prebuilt payload folder and an explicit build
receipt (`dbce.fzero-build`, version 1). The receipt pins source commit/tree,
product version, stock-only mode, dependency identities, PE import closure and
every approved payload file hash. It is build-time consistency evidence, not a
cryptographic attestation of the compiler. Never manufacture a receipt for an
old binary. The packager validates the receipt, x64 PE imports, the pinned
dynamically loaded WheelFfb.dll and notices, then adds this product's docs,
Setup.cmd and machine-readable manifest. ZIP ordering and timestamps are fixed.
It refuses path escapes, symlinks, user settings, private data, shader packs,
missing runtime dependencies, stale hashes and existing outputs. It runs no
payload executable and never scans/copies a whole build folder.

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build-stock -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded -DFZERO_DELUXE_GEN_DIR= -DFZERO_DELUXE_DATA_FILE=
cmake --build build-stock
python tools/stage_unified.py --build <fresh-stock-only-build> --output <new-stage-directory>
python tools/package_unified.py --payload <stock-only-stage> --receipt <build-receipt.json> --output <new-output-directory>
python tools/package_unified.py --verify <candidate.zip>
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_unified_package.py
```

Initialize the exact submodule pins and generate your own stock module first,
as described in README.md. The MSVC recipe uses its static runtime; a dynamic
runtime build must stage every imported non-system DLL with reviewed notices.
The tooling refuses to assume that a runtime installed on the build machine
will also exist on another user's computer.

Required payload: FZeroSNESRecomp.exe, its FZeroSNESRecompHeadless.exe replay
companion, WheelFfb.dll, approved build runtime DLLs,
checked-in assets/shaders, the pinned launcher fonts/images, licenses and
dependency/font notices. The staging tool reads CMake's exact dependency roots,
verifies clean gitlinks and the build's source stamp, and pins those assets.
The included replay adapter uses externally supplied pinned toolkit tools only
for optional normalized force observations; game recording and headless replay
do not require private toolkit access. No toolkit implementation is copied.
Receipt example and fields are documented in tools/package_unified.py.
The numeric upstream base comes from VERSION. The preview name/artifact stem
and canonical links come from game-product.json and are checked by the
packager. The full label is `DBCE F-Zero SNES Unified Preview
1.8.3+g<sourceRevision12>`; filenames use the DBCE preview namespace.
The package channel is candidate, with no new
published release implied. Submodule pins and toolkit file hashes remain
independent of the game version. Experimental actuator DLL overrides must be
reviewed and repinned explicitly; they are not silently treated as v0.13.0.

## Validation boundaries

Physical FFB is opt-in and requires attended acceptance. Replay compares game
simulation and normalized software force requests without wheel actuation.
The current BS replay adapter refuses Deluxe cases until their extra data is
pinned. Three-window diagnostic replay inside Surround does not validate
three physical monitors, scanout, focus or seams. Side world sprites/effects
remain incomplete; keep experimental availability in the product manifest.
No current installed payload, monitor profile or saved tune is changed by this
candidate work.

The approved interactive stock replay at `21f2605` completed 11,364 frames
and rendered the original CRT preset on three separate monitors, with FFB
disabled and the staged wheel DLL excluded. Placement, desktop capture and
sampled CPU/GL backbuffer evidence were retained. Center keyboard/foreground
focus failed acceptance; no definite application defect was established.
An attended focus check remains required. This does not establish optical
scanout/seams, comfort, complete side content or full rig acceptance.

Published source `14ea520` adds an optional softer CRT mask while preserving
the original preset and default. Its before/after comparison is simulated
CPU shader math, not a new GPU render. GPU compilation and visual acceptance
remain pending. Each separate view uses its own input texture size; the
reproduced 512-output-pixel band is evidence of a mask-alias contribution,
not proof of one mask stretched over the full desktop. No game, device,
display, install or release action is part of this documentation update.
